# Neural_Network_Scratch_Without_Any_Framework

## Overview

This project is an exploration of the fundamental concepts behind Loss and Optimization functions, and how they operate within deep learning models. My focus is on understanding and implementing partial derivatives and their role in the training process.

## Project Highlights

In this project, I've implemented a basic neural network from scratch using only a regression algorithm. The unique aspect of this work is that I have not used any deep learning or machine learning frameworks. This approach allows for a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanics of neural networks, providing a hands-on experience with the core principles that drive deep learning.

## Goals

- **Understand Partial Derivatives:** Explore how partial derivatives function in the context of neural networks.
- **Study Loss and Optimization Functions:** Gain insights into the role of these functions in training models.
- **Build a Neural Network from Scratch:** Develop a neural network without relying on external frameworks, using only raw code to implement the core functionalities.
